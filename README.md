## Description

This Study guide was created to help students going through the coding bootcamp prepare for the first day of class as well as the perwork. It contains notes on the basics of HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. The reason I built this project was to prepare myself for the start of the bootcamp by knowing the basics HMTL, CSS, and JS while also being able to complete the git flow. This project solves the problem of people being too scard to start learning to code. It is a process, but everybody must start with the basic building blocks for each language. 

I learned a lot making this project. One of the most interesting part of the prework was learning how to link two files together that contain different languages. Before starting the bootcamp prework, I had struggled in my own attempts to link two files together, but had no success. Programming can be very difficult but if you give you put the required time in it is achievable.
